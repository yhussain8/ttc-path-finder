    "- Need to mark on shortest path whether the last trip came over from a transit trip or walk\n",
    "- ~~Can use direction ID on trips to determine intersection blocks. The closest 4 stops - one for each direction, can consist of an intersection.~~ (Direction id is not a spatial direction but inward vs outward). Could use a data science cateogrical search to locate intersectional data as well based on a Nearest Neighbors search.\n",
    "- There is definitely a relationship between shapes and stop sequence. Each seperately or perhaps together might be the answer to the unique set of trips (route-stop combinations). At least for York Mills stops... a unique stop sequence for all trips through home stop id 917 have a 1-1 relationship with a unique shape id\n",
    "- Perhaps can use time duration actual real-time or schedule vs the shape distance traveled metric and come up with some form of speed estimate, optimize pathfinding in the future for traffic delays."
